0. README and Objectives

In this and upcoming projects, you will build a webpage from scratch based on a designer file.

🎯 Objectives

Focus only on the HTML structure

Use semantic HTML elements

Follow the content and layout structure from the design

No CSS, no style, no JavaScript for this task

The design file is available in Figma.
You may need a free account to view and duplicate it for measurements and content details.

🔎 Figma Notes

Some values may appear in decimals — rounding is fine
